# data files

All files here were created in the data_sources.R script, except

* tract_names.csv: we created this as a starting point for better identifying tracts by neighborhood or identifying features; these are neither formally accepted names or choices made with sufficient community engagement.
* health_analytic_data2020.csv: not sure about original source, probably CDC, NCHS; used for US life expectancy/AHDI comparison
