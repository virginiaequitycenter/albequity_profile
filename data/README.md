# data files

All files here were created in the data_sources.R script, except

* tract_names.csv: we created this as a starting point for better identifying tracts by neighborhood or identifying features; these are neither formally accepted names or choices made with sufficient community engagement.
* albco_profile_raceovertime.xlsx: we compiled the historical census counts using by hand using licensed access to Social Explorer as a source.
